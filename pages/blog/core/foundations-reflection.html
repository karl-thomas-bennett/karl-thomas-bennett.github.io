        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
          
        <p>
          My ego is interesting. I don't see myself as better than others, but I also don't see others as better than me. Others could be better at certain things, they could
          be doing better then me, but they aren't better (or worse) than me.<br>
          I have strong feelings about controlling/stifling or faking your emotions (though it is a good idea to control how you react to having certain emotions).
          That my future is not insurmountable - now I didn't consciously think that before but it was there, the idea that the future might be too overwhelming to do
          anything about. But it will take time and practise do get better at things that I need to and want to.
        </p> 
        
        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2> 
        <p>
          Knowing your values will aid in making difficult decisions, as these kinds of decisions are those that question your values. At a basic level, empathy is important
          when learning and programming because if you're not empathetic with/care about your co-workers/co-learners they are likely to reciprocate with the same attitude.
          You make others unhappy they'll make you unhappy. It also goes the other way, if you care about your co-workers they'll be more likely to care about you and it's
          much easier to learn or work out a problem if you aren't at eachother's throats all the time. Self awareness is important because knowing where there could
          be holes in your understanding is essential for learning and getting out of a rut. If you never accept that there could be a problem you'll never find it.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          How well I knew the content of the topics already. Most of the topics I already had an idea of but I wasn't confident in it, nor was I able to put it into words.
          I also wasn't applying these concepts in practise. I was surprised the concepts from core had a familiarity to them.
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Finding the right words to get across what I wanted to say. I've had to settle for good enough sometimes. I also found just starting quite challenging, once I got
          going it was usually alright but it always feels like it's a huge effort to undertake - this is why I said I would have like growth mindset to be earlier in the sprints
          (in the feedback form) as it has helped a lot but I haven't had much time to practise it. Though I wouldn't know what to push back for it.
        </p>

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
          Because core skills are the minimum requirement for getting a job and almost no other schools teach it. With coding, having the basics is important
          but beyond that you can generally learn on the job (which is also a core skill, being able to and willing to learn).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>
          For me in particular, definitely not. Since I already have a degree in computer science, studying core was the main reason I came here. It has helped me gain confidence
          both in my core skills and my tech skills as well as improving them, and I can now be more deliberate when it come to improving them both.
