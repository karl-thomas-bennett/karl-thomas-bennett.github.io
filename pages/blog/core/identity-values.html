            The thing I value most is genuinity (or genuiness). I like to show how I feel (though not proactively - I don't shove it in peoples' faces) and be true to myself instead of hiding it or trying to be someone I'm not and I dislike when others hide their feelings or fake feelings and I can generally tell when someone is lying to themselves/ ignoring their feelings. This won't make me hate you but I will try my best to make you drop the mask.
            This trait I have makes CV writing (and anything that requires assertiveness) difficult as I am adverse to using positive language unless I'm feeling positive as that would feel ingenuine.
            My culture is a little hard for me to define. I'd say the closest thing to culture I have would be my love for singing and music, and video games and streamers/content creators. I feel like these things have influenced my values to be more accepting of others and to be more compassionate (compounding, I feel like I would have been compassionate without this influence as well). For better or worse, these things (streamers in particular) have also given me the belief that no one really grows up. 100 years isn't enough for maturity. No one is superior.

            When it comes to strengths and limitations, I am a little lost. When completing the Myer Briggs test I get different results every time and of the things they say about those personalities only bits and pieces feel like they apply to me (but I am definitely introverted). The DOPE test says I'm 45% Dove, 45% Owl, and 10% Peacock (0% Eagle).
            In terms of strengths I believe I am:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patient</li>
            <li>Punctual</li>
            <li>Genuine</li>
            <li>Strong at logic and problem solving</li>
            <li>Compassionate</li>
            <li>Reliable</li>
            <li>Observant? Aware? (These words don't quite describe it correctly. I notice things. I am hesitant to say observant or aware because sometimes I am completely oblivous to things, but in general when I look, I see, though this doesn't always apply to finding things that are lost unfortunately)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In terms of limitations I struggle with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Confidence in myself and my abilities</li>
            <li>The concept of good enough (I'm a perfectionist)</li>
            <li>Being too blunt (I never mean to offend, but sometimes things don't come out quite how I expect them to)</li>
            <li>I'm sure there are more but I can't think of them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Patience and compassion should help my learning journey by helping me to get along with others. Being punctual, strong at logic and problem solving, and reliable should help with overcoming the challenges I will face.

            An example of when I struggled to work productively with someone was when I was cleaning and gardening for a family friend. I would take way longer on tasks than they expected, mainly due to me wanting to get the job done well. Too well. At the time I just didn't try as hard and focussed less on the details but now I would try figuring out what parts of the job were more important than others and focus on those (making sure not to spend too long on any one task) because this way I would be intentionally decreasing the quality to fit with the time budget I had without sacrificing the parts that are essential.
