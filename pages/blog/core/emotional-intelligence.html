                        To me emotional intelligence is being able to percieve, understand, and work with your emotions. Online they also state being able to control your emotions. I have had some experience with this and believe it is a bad idea. I was bullied as a child (not physically aside from maybe prodding thankfully), and this led to me trying to control my emotions. It got to the point where I didn't really feel anything. I remember bursting into tears one time but I didn't feel upset - I don't remember the exact circumstances. While it's been a long time since I behaved like this, I feel it had an impact on my social develoment due to those early years I missed. This roughly sums up what I'm thinking <a class="link" href="https://www.bigselfschool.com/post/stop-controlling-your-emotions">https://www.bigselfschool.com/post/stop-controlling-your-emotions</a>. I do however think you can guide your emotions, for example finding out what make you happy and using that to attempt to change how you feel (it won't always work but it's worth trying).
It differs to IQ in that IQ is a measure of how well you can analyse and understand logic problems (whether it's a good measure is debated), and highlights nothing of how well you can work with others or how much you understand yourself - which is covered by EQ.
Emotional intelligence is important because it is a large factor in determining how well you get along with others. Being able to understand your emotions, other people's emotions, and how to act because of them will help you to avoid (emotionally) hurting people and potentially let you flip someone's bad mood (make someone's day).
