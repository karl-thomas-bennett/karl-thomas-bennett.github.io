                    This is my current learning plan. I may update it in a later blog if I feel it's missing something:
    
                    I hope one day to be a game developer with logic, problem solving, and programming being my main strengths. The big obstacles that I face are limited opportunities, being consistent with how I use my time, losing motivation when things aren't going well / progressing, and being unconfident with my own abilities - many things I can do I am likely to say that I cannot or that I'm unsure if I can.
                    What I plan to learn and practise while at EDA are planning skills, both in time management and project management - breaking up what I need to do into smaller pieces and spending only so much time in one go working on a piece (planned breaks and changes of activity), confidence - lose my fear of being wrong, I don't fear my code being wrong but I often worry about whether or not I should say/write something. There is also room for improvement when it comes to coding but I feel like this shouldn't be my focus when studying here as my coding skills are already above average.
    
                    This is not set in stone but in order to help practise time management skills I am going to outline a rough schedule that I'll try to keep to:
    
                    (Will reformat into table when I get the time)
                    Being a programmer it feels right to make some variables and functions when creating this timetable
    
                    Work = fill with 1/2 hour core/tech (alternating) + 10 min break
                    Breaks = make bed, go for run, grab a drink, choir song practise - hmm I will need to add to this
                    Wake(time) = Wake up at time at the earliest
                    GetReady = Breakfast, shower, etc. : 1 hour
                    Lunch = Up to 1 hour lunch break starting between 12pm and 1pm (inclusive)
                    GameDev(time) = 1 hour game development starting at time
    
                    Monday: Wake(6:30am), GetReady, Work, Lunch, Work, GameDev(4pm), Dinner(5pm), Walk to choir at 5:45
                    Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday: Wake(6:30am), GetReady, Work, Lunch, Work, FreeTime(5pm), GameDev(6pm), FreeTime, Dinner(7:30 - 8:30)
                    Friday: Wake(6:30am), GetReady, Work, Lunch, MakeDinner, Work, GameDev(3 - 4pm, depending on covid level), Choir(5pm)
    
                    On top of this, aiming to get to bed by 10pm and 11pm at the latest (except on Mondays, choir runs quite late) should help with should help with getting good sleep which should help avoiding a bad mood, which can make me less productive and harder to work with.
    
                    If an activity has taken twice as long as expected (and I'm still not finished) or I feel completely stuck I plan to
                    A. Look it up if it is a tech related problem
                    B. Check Slack for other people with the same problem
                    C. Ask for help on Slack
    
                    And to finish off I expect the facilitation team to encourage communication and to answer any tough questions on Slack during their hours.
