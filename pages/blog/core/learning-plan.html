        <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
        <p>
          My long term goals for my career are to be able to provide significant input to making games that I would enjoy playing. Maybe even make my own games company.
          In the short term I still want to work as a web developer as jobs in web development would be a good opportunity to practise and experience working in a team 
          (and making frequent commits), would teach me useful skills for making a website which is still very relevant in game dev, and they're more abundant than game dev
          opportunities. <br>
          <br>
          After my time with foundations I have discovered another weakness I have. I am not, currently, that good at keeping to my own timetable. I can keep commitments when other
          people are involved but I'm finding it easy to cheat when I've made it myself, after all I could have just made it differently. I guess the main thing keeping me
          from failing commitments when other people are involved is that I'll feel that I've let them down, so perhaps acting as if I would let myself down, if I changed
          a commitment in such a way that it hinders what I can do in the time I have, would help. <br>
          <br>
          However I have also realised a few more of my strenghts. I am a good listener - I didn't put it down before because it didn't jump out as being something useful to
          coding or learning but it is, being able to understand what people mean makes conversation and explaining things easier (because you'll both be on the same page). Also,
          not strictly relevant but I discovered that I'm quite a good reader - I read the first 5 pages of the first Harry Potter book to my younger cousins, 7 and 9, auntie, 
          and nana (it was getting late so we had to stop). By reading what the text meant I was able to speak it with the right tone so that it was entertaining. They were all
          very impressed. Back to strengths, speaking of reading I am good at reading other people's emotions and (for lack of better words) I am quick to care (about people's
          issues and welbeing). <br>
          <br>
          Although I had some time management issues in foundations, since I'm not organising myself as much, I think the biggest non-technical challenge for me will be not speaking
          in front of the group (and things like that) but having the courage to volunteer. Doing it usually isn't too much of a problem but I can be shy. I do think it is a challenge
          I can overcome however. <br>
          <br>
          Non-technical skills I want to develop over bootcamp are teamwork, leadership skills, giving and receiving feedback, communication (telling people when something 
          unexpected happens), and reflection skills. For most of these I feel like I should be pretty good at them but they're not practised, they're untested, and I'm not 
          confident that they're up to scratch because of that. <br>
          <br>
          I expect the bootcamp team to be a good role model for the core skills we have been (and will be?) learning. To support us, but also let us discover our own ways to
          solve the problems we'll face. And to not leave anyone behind (not that I thought you would). <br>
          <br>
          If I'm having trouble with something or feeling frustrated and it has been a little while without much progress I should, A, take a short break and, B, ask for help
          first from my peers and then facilitators if everyone's stuck. Unfortunately I am 10x more comfortable asking for help in person than online but I'll do my best
          while we're still in level 2, maybe using video calls could help. <br>
          <br>
          As a commitment to how I will manage my workload, firstly, I need to keep away from distractions during class hours (this will be easy in level 1, more difficult in 
          level 2). Secondly, I need to split things up and focus on completing small parts of the work I need to do until the whole is finished - particularly with code,
          I need practise commiting more often (and from my experimenting by making chess I've found a good plan goes a long way, and splitting up logic in the planning phase is
          essential). And finally, I plan to work safely with others by being mindful about how what I might say or do could affect others, in other words, avoid saying things that
          that could unintentionally hurt them.
        </p>
        <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
        <p>
          I hope one day to be a game developer with logic, problem solving, and programming being my main strengths. The big obstacles that I face are limited opportunities, being consistent with how I use my time, losing motivation when things aren't going well / progressing, and being unconfident with my own abilities - many things I can do I am likely to say that I cannot or that I'm unsure if I can.<br>
          What I plan to learn and practise while at EDA are planning skills, both in time management and project management - breaking up what I need to do into smaller pieces and spending only so much time in one go working on a piece (planned breaks and changes of activity), confidence - lose my fear of being wrong, I don't fear my code being wrong but I often worry about whether or not I should say/write something. There is also room for improvement when it comes to coding but I feel like this shouldn't be my focus when studying here as my coding skills are already above average.<br>
          <br>
          In relation to learning, my potential limitations include a lack of motivation, particularly with things I don't find interesting, pessimism, I tend to look for ways that things won't work instead of ways they will, and occasional defensiveness, continuing to argue a point for a bit after it has been disproven because of emotional attachment. <br>
          In terms of strengths I have a strong drive when I am motivated, I like to experiment (provided I'm interested), and I prefer to treat others as an equal (perhaps part of the reason why I struggle with finding my strength as I don't like to put myself above others) - while this will make working with those that think they're better than me strained, it lets me be able to consider advice/ideas from someone who is less knowledgeable on a subject and, as a side effect, it makes me more likeable.<br>
          <br>
          This is not set in stone but in order to help practise time management skills I am going to outline a rough schedule that I'll try to keep to:<br>
          <br>
          (Will reformat into table when I get the time)<br>
          Being a programmer it feels right to make some variables and functions when creating this timetable<br>
          <br>
          Work = fill with 1/2 hour core/tech (alternating) + 10 min break<br>
          Breaks = make bed, go for run, grab a drink, choir song practise - hmm I will need to add to this<br>
          Wake(time) = Wake up at time at the earliest<br>
          GetReady = Breakfast, shower, etc. : 1 hour<br>
          Lunch = Up to 1 hour lunch break starting between 12pm and 1pm (inclusive)<br>
          GameDev(time) = 1 hour game development starting at time<br>
          <br>
          Monday: Wake(6:30am), GetReady, Work, Lunch, Work, GameDev(4pm), Dinner(5pm), Walk to choir at 5:45<br>
          Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday: Wake(6:30am), GetReady, Work, Lunch, Work, FreeTime(5pm), GameDev(6pm), FreeTime, Dinner(7:30 - 8:30)<br>
          Friday: Wake(6:30am), GetReady, Work, Lunch, MakeDinner, Work, GameDev(3 - 4pm, depending on covid level), Choir(5pm)<br>
          <br>
          On top of this, aiming to get to bed by 10pm and 11pm at the latest (except on Mondays, choir runs quite late) should help with should help with getting good sleep which should help avoiding a bad mood, which can make me less productive and harder to work with.<br>
          <br>
          As for how and when I will seek help in a timely way, if an activity has taken twice as long as expected (and I'm still not finished) or I feel completely stuck I plan to<br>
          A. Look it up if it is a tech related problem<br>
          B. Check Slack for other people with the same problem<br>
          C. Ask for help on Slack<br>
          <br>
          And to finish off I expect the facilitation team to encourage communication and to answer any tough questions on Slack during their hours.
