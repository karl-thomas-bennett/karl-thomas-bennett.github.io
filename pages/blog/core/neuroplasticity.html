                  <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

                  <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
                    
                  <p>
                    The main principle of neuroplasticity is that intelligence isn't fixed, you can change it by practising - by not giving up. 
                    This can benefit those that think they're bad at something, because chances are they're not. They just haven't spent as much time 
                    on it as others and they give up because they aren't performing well right now. Believing intelligence is fixed is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
                    You aren't good at something, you don't believe you ever will be, you stop trying, and you never get better. Believeing in malleable intelligence 
                    is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. You aren't good at something, you believe you can get better, you keep trying, and you do get better.
                  </p> 
                  
                  <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2> 
                  <p>
                    By understanding that, as long as I'm learning something and practising, I can change my strengths. I have always been strong at maths and 
                    considerably weaker at English when it comes to subjects. I was good at creative writing however, and I believe the main contributer to this 
                    was that I read a lot of fiction - I had plenty of practise with understanding and coming up with those sorts of ideas (and creative writing 
                    was never assessed under a clock, you always had a comfortable amount of time to do it). If I were to practise writing more, and read more 
                    non-fiction my ability with English should increase to be more comparable with my maths ability (which like creative writing was also reinforced 
                    with constant exposure and practise). <br>
                    <br>
                    My younger brother is the complete opposite to me, fantastic at English, poor at maths. I wonder if he could also benefit 
                    from this as he is contantly doubting his maths ability even though most of the time he can do it when he tries.

                  <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Being more rounded in thinking, practising both analytical thinking and creative/imaginitive/emotive thinking.</li>
                    <li>
                      Test motorskills, do something that you find difficult. The example from the video is brushing your teeth with you less dominant hand 
                      while balancing on one leg. Another example could be trying to juggle a football (or just juggle), with your less dominant foot if it's too easy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Learn a new language</li>
                    <li>Find flow state</li>
                    <li>Learn something simple but new.</li>
                    <li>Meditate</li>
                    <li>Exercise - in particular aerobic exercise</li>
                    <li>Intermittent fasting</li>
                    <li>Including magnesium, cholesterol, anioxidants (like tumeric and ginger), vitamin B12, and DHA omega 3 fatty acids in your diet.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
                  <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
                  <p>
                    A growth mindset is a mindset that believes that intelligence, creativity, or any other metric of ability, can be improved with time and practice.
                    It is the antithesis of a fixed mindset which believes that intelligence, etc. is fixed, unchanging. This mindset can lead to people feeling the need to 
                    compare themselves to others, to avoid making mistakes, to avoid challenges (because that would increase the chance of mistakes). A growth mindset on the other
                    hand promotes seeking out challenges as a medium for growth. It is likely that for some things you already have a growth mindset, but for others
                    you could have a fixed mindset, for example, I tend to try to avoid writing blogs like this because I think I'm bad at writing blogs - but if
                    I ran into a difficult maths or coding problem I would look for ways to solve it because I think I'm good at it. It is super relevant because being aware
                    that I don't have a growth mindset in some areas and being able to try applying when I feel stuck is going to help immensely with the feeling of wanting to
                    give up.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
                  <p>
                    No, I almost felt like I expected it. I kinda knew about a lot of the ideas about a growth mindset from my own experiences of the effects of a fixed mindset.
                    I was starting to see the flaws of a fixed mindset and bits and pieces for how to improve, but nothing was concrete and I wasn't confident with it. My
                    understanding before doing this research wasn't quite a growth mindset but it was leaning towards it.   
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
                    <p>
                      I used to always be waiting for something to happen, everything's going to be better/well once I've done this. This is a rather fixed mindset approach,
                      believing that I can't improve or I'm stuck until I finish what I'm doing. Instead I am going to balance work I can do easily and work I could get stuck on,
                      not giving either one too much time. On top of that I should try to view blog writing and other core exercises as a challenge rather than a chore.

                  <p>
                    As I tend to get stuck with core activities more, I might try adding gamedev to my work cycle instead of at the end of the day. I might hold off on doing
                    that just yet though as I have been getting better (and therefore distracted less) and I believe I can get to the point where I can finish these activities
                    without needing a long break in the form of mental recuperation. Other than that I don't think my learning plan needs to change, though I could stick to my
                    timetable a little better.
