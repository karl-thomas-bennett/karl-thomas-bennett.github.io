          <div class="fixed">I'm fixed. <br>Not even scrolling can get rid of me!</div>
          <div class="absolute">My position is absoulte. <br>I stick to the page, even if the page moves, and I make room for no one (but my starting position is based off the last element)</div>
          <div class="relative green">I'm relatively positioned. <br>I make way for others relatively positioned, or they make way for me</div>
          <div class="relative yellow">I'm relatively positioned too.</div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>Relatively positioned elements will move out of the way of other relatively positioned objects that were declared (made) before them.</p>
            <p>Absolutely positioned elements are positioned based off the element before them but they don't care if another element is in the way (also negative margins work).</p>
            <p>Fixed elements stick to the screen. No matter how you scroll, fixed elements will always be in the same place.</p>
            <p>Give it a go and see for yourself. I've made this page twice as long as the others so you can scroll.</p>

            <p><br>Here's how I made the relative elements:<br></p>
            <img src="../../../images/Relative HTML.PNG" alt="Some html"> 
            <img src="../../../images/Relative CSS.PNG" alt="Some css">

            <p><br>The absolute element:<br></p>
            <img src="../../../images/Absolute HTML.PNG" alt="Some html"> 
            <img src="../../../images/Absolute CSS.PNG" alt="Some css">

            <p><br>And the fixed element:<br></p>
            <img src="../../../images/Fixed HTML.PNG" alt="Some html"> 
            <img src="../../../images/Fixed CSS.PNG" alt="Some css">

            <p><br>See how the fixed and absolute elements are placed before the relative elements. This is done to avoid having to work out their positions based on the last relative objects.</p>
            <p><br>Also the "z-index" you can see in the absolute and fixed element css is to push them to the front. I used 5 but any positive number will do.</p>
