                  <h2>A Time I Solved a Problem</h2>
                  <p>
                    This is not exactly a simple problem I got blocked on but I managed a fairly elegant solution. I was making a game during my 
                    study at victoria university using Processing, a program that helps with coding very graphical solutions - like a game. I was making a game that
                    would detect if the player had drawn a zig-zag line, and if so, the line would shoot forward as a projectile that could hit your opponent. The problem I got
                    stuck with was detecting a zig-zag without being too strict. I had the main idea for how I would do it, by checking the angle difference between the lines
                    they made, checking if the small angle was less than about 30 degrees and in the opposite direction to the last one. I understand that that was fairly
                    complicated and may not have described it well enough but that was working, it wasn't the problem. The problem arose from how I had to record the player's drawing.
                    Their drawing was represented as a bunch of dots with lines connecting them - the dots being where the mouse was during that frame or game-tick. When a player 
                    made their zig or zag it would often be made up of more than one line, meaning to the game it looked like a curve instead of a sharp turn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At first, I didn't know what was going on, it just didn't seem to be working. So I did the equivalent of Console.logging, and decided to obtain more information
                    about the problem. I got the program to draw the dots that made up the line in red so I could see what they looked like and sure enough, there wasn't a single dot
                    at the end of each zig or zag but multiple. Next I talked to myself about the problem, trying to figure out what exactly it was that I wanted, similar to the
                    Rubber Ducky method but without the duck. After thinking about it for a bit I decided to try something. What if I took every 5th dot and drew a line between those
                    instead (for the calculation, the player still sees the line like normal). This made game see the line much closer to how we see the line and after covering a
                    few edge cases I was able to get the line working... Mostly. You could draw curves in some scenarios and it would still work but I had to finish the rest of the
                    game before a deadline so I never fixed that.

                  <h2>Reflection on Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
                  <h3>Psudocode</h3>
                  <p>
                    At this point I'm not that confident in using this technique. I'm sure I could and I would be fine at doing so but I'd feel more comfortable
                    using a programming language. I should definitely use this as part of planning though because I can often sink time into one aspect of a function and then
                    forget what I'm supposed to be doing next once I've finished it. If I had used psudocode (or psudo-psudocode), then I could skip over the implementation 
                    details of the more complicated parts, allowing me to plan the whole function first and never get lost.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Trying something</h3>
                  <p>
                    I am very confident in using this technique. This technique is something you should do to help gain information about the problem you're trying to solve.
                    When you don't fully understand a problem, try something. If it didn't work, try to work out why (and maybe try a few things). If it did work, you might be
                    able to work out why it worked but otherwise try something else until it doesn't work (I find it easier to narrow down what doesn't work than what does when
                    problems get more complicated).  
                  </p>
                  <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
                  <p>
                    I won't talk to an object, but I will talk to myself and to others (even if they have very little idea what I'm talking about). This method is about
                    telling a rubber ducky your problem, the purpose is to get you to say the problem out loud as you'll be more likely to pick out flaws because you
                    spend more time on saying the sentence than thinking it and it's easy to notice when something sounds wrong. I prefer to talk to myself or others 
                    about the problem which should serve simialr purpose. This technique is about helping you understand the problem, and in particular what misconceptions
                    about the problem you might have.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
                  <p>
                    I am very confident with this. Reading error messages can give you a very good starting point for where to look for your programming errors, however they will
                    not always point out the cause so sometimes it's still up to you to work out how an error appeared and where the source of the error is actually located.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Console.logging</h3>
                  <p>
                    I am very confident with this. This techniques is especially useful when error messages have failed you. If the program crashes for a timeout or stack-overflow
                    error, the program will often not give you an error message and will just terminate. In this instance you can litter you code with log statements to find out 
                    where the code got stuck, and with a bit of time you'll find the infinite while loop you accidentally never broke out of on line 462.<br>
                    It can also be useful for logging what values variables have at a given time in the program - if an input is giving you an unexpected value, what is that 
                    unexpected value.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Googling</h3>
                  <p>
                    If you're having trouble with something and it's not too niche, there's a good chance someone else has also had the same problem and asked for help online.
                    Don't reinvent the wheel, problem solving is as much about creating you own solutions as it is finding someone else's that fits your problem. I am also confident
                    in my ability to google for a problem I'm facing. In order to do this you must boil down the problem into parts, or into something that's more general so you have
                    a greater chance of finding a solution (or solutions) that, perhaps with a bit of tweaking, can solve your problem.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
                  <p>
                    I am not as confident with this one as the ones before. I can sometimes spend much longer on a problem than I need to because I don't ask others for help. I find
                    it easy if they're right beside me but, particularly in lockdowns, I find it hard to reach out. (and to admit that I've been on a problem for way too long). Asking
                    peers though is a great way to break past a block that's leading to frustration or demotivation, as they can usually help since they're working on the same thing, and 
                    if they can't it's still nice to vent to someone or help them with their problems for a break from your own.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
                  <p>Pretty much ditto, but it's very unlikely they can't help.</p>
                  <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                  <p>
                    I think I am decent at this. The idea is that whenever you take a while to solve a problem and then quickly solve it after doing something, take note of what
                    you did and try it sooner next time you end up with a similar sort of problem.
